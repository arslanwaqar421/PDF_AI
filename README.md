# PDF_AI

### Project Description

PDF_AI is a RAG application allows users to upload PDF files directly through a chat interface. The uploaded PDFs are processed and fed to OpenAI, enabling users to ask questions about the content of these files. The backend is built using Django with RESTful APIs, ensuring a robust and scalable server-side architecture. On the frontend, a React-based interface provides a smooth and interactive user experience. This combination of technologies allows for efficient data handling and seamless user interactions, making the application both powerful and user-friendly.
